I have attached the dataset to the project description on Crowdmark so that you do not have to register for an account on Kaggle. I have also reduced the number of variables, to help to limit the scope of the project. The data set you can download from Crowdmark contains the following data from the original dataset:

Variable Description

Title Movie or series title

Languages Languages in the film

Series or Movie Series or standalone movie

Hidden Gem Score Hidden Gem Score from FlixGem

Runtime Runtime Category

Director Director

IMDb Score IMDb Score

Rotten Tomatoes ScoreRotten Tomatoes Score

Metacritic Score Metacritic Score

Summary Movie Summary

Note that IMDb, Rotten Tomatoes, and Metacritic are all differnt websites which specialize in rating movies based on general public and movie critic reviews.

Objectives and evaluation

The completion of each task is worth 25 points. The quality of presentation will also be worth 25 points, i.e. clarity of explanation, plots, tables, and code.

The length of the projects will vary, depending on the number and formatting of figures and tables and the conciseness of the writing. Rather than focusing on the number of pages, I encourage students to focus on completing each task (and subtask) below to the best of their ability in the clearest and most efficient manner.

Tasks to complete

Task 1: Data wrangling and exploratory data analyses

The first task is to do some data wrangling (i.e. cleaning and manipulation) and conduct some exploratory data analyses. The film company DOES NOT want results for Series, only for Movies, since they only produce movies. Second, they know that there is missingness in some of the variables, but they are content to allow you to drop any records containing any missing values for the purposes of this analysis (so you should).

Include any plots and summary statistics that you think will aid in supporting your assessments.

Based on the subsetted and cleaned data, please answer the following questions:

b. Do any of the three review site scores (IMDb, Rotten Tomatoes, Metacritic) seem to be strongly or weakly correlated with the Hidden Gem Scores? Explain briefly the reasons behind your assessment and the nature of those associations.

c. The company has a theory that people are becoming more acceptable of longer movies because they can watch them at home on Netflix and other content-collecting sites. Do you notice any trend over time in the Hidden Gem Scores by category of RunTime Length? Explain briefly the reasons behind your assessment.

Task 2: Factors of the Hidden Gem Score

r.github.io/regression_trees (https://uc-r.github.io/regression_trees) with example code. Apply the rpart function to the data using the Hidden Gem Score as the outcome and Languages, Runtime, IMDb Score, Rotten Tomatoes Score and Metacritic Score as predictors. Summarize what you think are the most important features for predicting the hiddden Gem Score based on the fitted tree and summarize how well your predictions perform. NOTE: You DO NOT have to implement any Bagging or Split Optimization from the article beyond what the rpart function already provides. (but of course you can if youâ€™re excited to do so).

Task 3: An H-index for directors

The last task they would like you to complete is to find a way to identify directors who produce films that have high Hidden Gem Scores. The problem is how to use the Hidden Gem Scores for directors, given that all of the directors have directed different numbers of films in the dataset. If you use the maximum Hidden Gem Score for each director as the measure of how good they are, then directors with more movies are likely to look better because they have more chances to have a high score. If you use the average Hidden Gem Score, then directors with fewer movies can look spuriously good because they produce a single hgih score movie.

This is similar to the problem that we see with trying to rank researchers based on their citations. Researchers who publish lots of papers will have lots of citations to their work, even if none of their work is not cited often. Researchers who publish a small number of highly cited papers have a much smaller of body of work to be judged upon. What has been proposed is a measure to balance quantity and quality, the H-index. The Hindex in reseach for a researcher is equal to the number, H, of publications for that researcher which have all been cited AT LEAST H times. For example, a researcher who has published three papers which have been cited 1 time, 4 times and 100 times respectively has an H-index of 2, because they have 2 papers that have been cited at least 2 times. A researcher who has published 5 papers that have been cited 3, 6, 7, 8, and 9 times has an H-index of 4 because they have 4 papers that have been cited at least 4 times.

For this task, find the top 10 directors in the dataset according to an Hidden Gem H-index (an HG-H index?) defined as the the number of films, H, in the dataset that they have directed which have Hiddden Gem Scores that are greater than or equal to H and produce them in a table with their associated HGâˆ’H index.
